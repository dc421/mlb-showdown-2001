- steal throwrollresult doesnt go away for defensive player if they pitch before the hitter swings
    - steal then resolve then steal -> no throwrollresult for second steal for offense
    - consecutive steals -> bases-only spoiler (not outs or game log) during second roll for throw
    - single tag OR ifin then steal for the third out -> not showing steal throwRollResult & double buttons for defense
