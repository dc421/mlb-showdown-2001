- double steal then ibb, throwrollresult weird
- double steal adv
- double steal ifin
- dp/tag/advance and then steal -> no throwRollResult listed after steal for defense
    - ifin then steal -> no throwRollResult, jumped to next at-bat pitcher/batter
    - double adv then steal -> shows wrong old throw roll result?
- double adv/tag then ibb -> new runner appears with throwrollresult, before guy who gets walked is at the plate

- consecutive steals: not showing throwRollResult, bases jumping early
- non-pitcher pinch hitter skips inning change message
- dont show relievers as options to replace hitters before they are eligible to enter
    - dont show SPs icons before they are allowed to exit
    - do show your DHs icon from the bench before the 7th
- pinch hitter displaying own teams pitcher as opponent before refresh on awaiting lineup change
    - replacement pitcher has to sub for hitter P AND pitching P
    - somehow got two replacement pitchers playing 1B?
    - if you have two replacement pitchers/hitters they both get highlighted when substituting
- SP allowed to sub out early again?
- series game stuck on lineup submitted page
- dashboard for completed games always shows "invalid date"
- away team picks dh/no dh before g3
    - make sure sp comes back in g5
- show relievers who are tired AND relievers who pitched last game
    - reliever fatigue (pitched last game indicator? fatigue indicator immediately correct, even after pinch hitter replacement?)
    - reliever game 1 throws til 3 runs score, but pulled before throwing tired pitch - tired next game?
- previous game lineup assumed for the next game (dh / no dh)



gordon: not tired, 1 inning but didn't throw a pitch in the 2nd (start of 7th)
rivera: not tired, 3 runs but didn't throw a pitch (start of 8th)
santiago: under innings limit (enters after rivera 8th)
replacement pitcher in 10th

tired: r.white (enter in 7th)
henry: inserted and immediately pulled (start of 7th)
telford: didn't enter at all
