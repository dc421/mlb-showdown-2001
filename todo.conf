#- adv then steal game log reveals outcome of advance
    - ifin then steal -> game log reveals outcome of advance
- consecutive steals: not showing throwRollResult, bases jumping early (have writeup below)
#- if you replace the pitching player, it doesnt replace the P in the lineup
######-- away team picks dh/no dh before g3
    - make sure sp comes back in g5
######-- previous game lineup assumed for the next game (dh / no dh)
######- series game stuck on lineup submitted page
#####- show relievers who pitched last game
    - reliever game 1 throws til 3 runs score, but pulled before throwing tired pitch should not be tired next game


Im seeing issues when the offensive player steals 2nd, and then after being successful, attempts to steal 3rd before the defensive player reacts to the first steal.

offense hits Steal 2nd
offense sees throwRollResult, defense sees ROLL FOR THROW. offense clicks Steal 3rd.
offense sees Waiting for throw... and defense still sees ROLL FOR THROW on the steal of 2nd base. Defense clicks ROLL FOR THROW.
All correct to this point.

At this point, the offense sees the bases and game log change and the Swing Away button (all correct). The issue is that the offense SHOULD also see the throwRollResult box for the stolen base attempt of 3rd base. As for the defense, they see the game log update correctly and see ROLL FOR THROW on the steal of 3rd, correctly. However, they SHOULD also see the throwRollResult box from the steal of 2nd, and they should see the runner on 2nd base (instead they already see the runner on 3rd base or missing, depending on the result of the steal of 3rd).
After the defense hits ROLL FOR THROW again, everything is fine, except that the defensive player now should see the throwRollResult for the steal of 3rd.
