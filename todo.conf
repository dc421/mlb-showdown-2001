#- know when in the game bench players can be in the field (lineup validation prevented by dp? )
    - once this works make it so we no longer see "Selecting Pitcher..." on the offense side since its not the pitcher
#- replacement pitcher has null speed
    - replacement pitcher has to sub for hitter P AND pitching P
- away team picks dh/no dh before g3
    - make sure sp comes back in g5
- show relievers who are tired AND relievers who pitched last game
    - reliever fatigue (pitched last game indicator? fatigue indicator immediately correct, even after pinch hitter replacement?)
    - reliever game 1 throws til 3 runs score, but pulled before throwing tired pitch - tired next game?
- walkoff walk/homer still not showing ROLL FOR SWING button
#- consecutive intentional walks shows weird bases
#- tries to resolve steal before bunt even if bunt was first
- steal: bunt steal adv tag ifin dp
- adv: ibb bunt steal
- tag: ibb bunt steal
- ifin: ibb bunt steal
- dp: ibb bunt steal
#- series game stuck on lineup submitted page
#- pinch hitter displaying own teams pitcher as opponent before refresh on awaiting lineup change
#- multi-runner tag-up not listing outs in game log message
- previous game lineup assumed for the next game (dh / no dh)
