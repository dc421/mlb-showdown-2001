- double steal not working
- dp no ROLL FOR SWING?

#- walkoff win not showing up on dashboard
- bench player cant play field before 7th
    - dont show relievers as options to replace hitters before they are eligible to enter
    - pinch hitter displaying own teams pitcher as opponent before refresh on awaiting lineup change
    - non-pitcher pinch hitter skips inning change message
    - should be able to put your benched dh into the game before the 7th (just has no icon, backend working)
    - replacement pitcher has to sub for hitter P AND pitching P
    - if you have two replacement pitchers/hitters they both get highlighted when substituting
    - can you sub out the SP early if you get to the invalid lineup screen?- series game stuck on lineup submitted page
- dashboard for completed games always shows "invalid date"
- away team picks dh/no dh before g3
    - make sure sp comes back in g5
- show relievers who are tired AND relievers who pitched last game
    - reliever fatigue (pitched last game indicator? fatigue indicator immediately correct, even after pinch hitter replacement?)
    - reliever game 1 throws til 3 runs score, but pulled before throwing tired pitch - tired next game?
- previous game lineup assumed for the next game (dh / no dh)



gordon: not tired, 1 inning but didn't throw a pitch in the 2nd (start of 7th)
rivera: not tired, 3 runs but didn't throw a pitch (start of 8th)
santiago: under innings limit (enters after rivera 8th)
replacement pitcher in 10th

tired: r.white (enter in 7th)
henry: inserted and immediately pulled (start of 7th)
telford: didn't enter at all
